# Exam-tasks

I helped students of my generation with C# exam projects where I had to explain technical concepts in a way that was easy for them to understand. Although the task was not difficult, I got some idea of ​​what it's like to work in a group with more people.

## Description

- Create the following methods within the Program class:

  a) Integer input method: The method returns a value of type int and has no input parameters. The method asks the user to enter a number, and then allows that number to be entered. The method returns a value that represents the number that the user enters.

  b) Method for creating an array and entering array elements: The method creates a new array of a given length, and then the user enters the array elements. The method takes the length of the string as an input parameter, and returns the string of decimal numbers entered.

  c) A method that returns a value of type double: The method has as an input parameter a series of decimal numbers representing the amounts of voluntary financial contributions. The method returns the amount of the largest monetary contribution of all the contributions in the sequence.

  d) A method that has no parameters and does not return a value: The method from task a) is called to enter an integer N, which represents the length of the string. The user is notified with a message that he should enter N amounts of voluntary monetary contributions. The method from task b) is called in order to enter a series of monetary contribution amounts. The method from task c) is called in order to determine the amount of the largest cash contribution from all the contributions in a series. The user is informed with a message that he should repeat the entire procedure. The method from task b) is called again to enter a series of new amounts of monetary contributions. The method from task c) is called in order to determine the amount of the largest cash contribution from all the contributions in a series. The highest value of the amount of cash contributions that were entered first is printed, and then the highest value of new cash contributions. It checks which of the two values ​​is higher and prints a message about it.
